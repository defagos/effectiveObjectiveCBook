3. Use NSAssert to check conditions. Do not forget to disable it in the release build using the NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS pre-processor definition

6. Use the #pragma mark directive to create distinct sections in your implementation files (e.g. for construction / desctruction, protocol implementation functions, etc.). XCode displays these sections in its code browser (since this only works in implementation files, no need to #pragma mark sections in header files, though)

25. Use XCode code templates wisely. Some contain minor typos, and their style might not be consistent with yours (though both should not be too far from each other :-) )

39c. Use Crustify for formatting ( http://www.invasivecode.com/2010/05/format-your-code-with-crustify/). XCode has poor flexibility and poor
support. Also see http://hackertoys.com/2008/09/18/adding-a-code-beautifier-script-to-xcode/. Still must find if it is possible to have the script being executed every time the user presses enter...

53. Use #pragma mark - wisely , e.g. to separate classes in implementation files.
